# Find the maximum of a list of numbers
## Aim:
To write a program to find the maximum of a list of numbers.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the list of marks as input
2.	Use the sort() function or max() function or use the for loop to find the maximum mark.
3.	Return the maximum value
## Program:

def max_marks(list1):

    # write your code here

    max1=list1[0]

    for i in list1:

        if i>max1:

            max1 = i

    return max1

max_marks([88, 67, 77, 93, 95, 11, 67, 89, 56, 89])
